REST(REpresentational State Transfer) - Client and Server stateless communication protocol - Http request response

URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
GET - Provides a read only access to a resource.

PUT - Used to create a new resource.

DELETE - Used to remove a resource.

POST - Used to update an existing resource or create a new resource.

Jersey framework can be used, Apache Tomcat.

Common Gateway Interface(CGI), a specification for transferring information between a World Wide Web server and a CGI program.

File -> new project -> Dynamic web project

Serializable interface - > object is converted to stream of bytes and stored in a file.

Web.xml - > configurations are written. 

File ? export ? Web ? War File . This War file is deployed in tomcat , gets extracted. http://localhost:8080 Advanced rest client

Tomcat is a servlet container. JVM maintains garbage collection. Servlet calls service() method to process client's request. init() -> service() ->destroy()

HttpSession session = request.getSession(); session handling. @WebServlet - this annotations are used , if these are used, we do not need web.xml

Hibernate - object relational mapping. The Bean module provides BeanFactory, which is a sophisticated implementation of the factory pattern.

primitive data types to objects is called boxing (wrapper class)

Spring - applicationcontext xml. For object comparison, we use equals() method. When creating bean, set it to singleton

public static void main(String[] args) {
      ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("Beans.xml");
      HelloWorld obj = (HelloWorld) context.getBean("helloWorld");
      obj.getMessage();
   }

The Beans.xml is used to assign unique IDs to different beans and to control the creation of objects with different values without impacting any of the Spring source files.
With lazy instantiation, a program refrains from creating certain resources until the resource is first needed -- freeing valuable memory space. 
Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the java virtual machine. Singleton classhas private constructor.

IoC means inversion of control.The Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) patterns are all about removing dependencies from your code.
Here is dependency.
public class TextEditor {
   private SpellChecker spellChecker;
   
   public TextEditor() {
      spellChecker = new SpellChecker();
   }
}

Here is Ioc.Thus the flow of control has been "inverted" by Dependency Injection (DI) because you have effectively delegated dependances to some external system.
public class TextEditor {
   private SpellChecker spellChecker;
   
   public TextEditor(SpellChecker spellChecker) {
      this.spellChecker = spellChecker;
   }
}
1> Constructor-based DI is accomplished when the container invokes a class constructor with a number of arguments, each representing a dependency on the other class.
2> Setter-based DI is accomplished by the container calling setter methods on your beans after invoking a no-argument constructor or no-argument static factory method to instantiate your bean.

Beans are objects of spring Ioc container. Spring JDBCTemplate class used for database applications. Transactions - Atomicity,Consistency,Isolation,Durability.
The web.xml file will be kept in the WebContent/WEB-INF directory of your web application -> used for mapping spring with html. @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET) -> Controller
In factory pattern, we create objects but we dont reveal the logic of object creation. Java constructor has no return type. Default accesss specifier means accessible in same package.
Time Series Analysis in R forecasts pattern. Supervised Learning(Training data set), Unsupervised Learning(K-Means) , Recommendation ( Amazon provides what products to buy) [ Also known
as Collaborative Filtering].
Apache Mahout is used for Machine Laerning with java and hadoop. HDFS is Hadoop Distributed File System. Map creates key-value pairs, reduce divides those into smaller tuples.

Microservices - A complex application divided into several small independant modules. Spring Boot provides this service - Ioc and Aspect Oriented Programming(modular approach). Jersey can also be used.

Functional Programming - It is declarative programming. No control flow. Only function calls(recursions). Prolog.
Imperative programming - There is control flow. Loops, conditions, functions are there. C,C++,JAVA.
Runtime Polymorphism - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-method-dispatch-runtime-polymorphism-java/
Encapsulation - private data members, public getter settter mathods.

Main features of spring - DI and Aspect Oriented Programming. DI helps to make classes independant. AOP tries to decouple cross-cutting concerns from the objects they affect. 
The functions that span multiple points of an application are called cross-cutting concerns. Three main parts of Spring - Context, Beans, Core. @Autowired is used to get rid off 
outer bean - inner bean thing. Spring does it itself. Apache axis2 was used to convert WSDL files to java classes.

HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("ABC",10);
map.put("pqr",20);
Integer a = map.get("pqr");

Vector is synchronized in java but, ArrayList is not. Synchronized means two threads can not access same vector at a time - JVM handles this.

Java 8 supports functional programming. We are not saying how to do, we mention what to do -> FP. How to do is IP.

class Mutable{
  private int value;

  public Mutable(int value) {
     this.value = value;
  }

  //getter and setter for value
}

class Immutable {
  private final int value;

  public Immutable(int value) {
     this.value = value;
  }

  //only getter
}

For Immutable objects, we can not change the value of the members. 

@requestmapping is used in spring for mapping one URL.
